**Xcode 4 Cocoa-Python Templates**

This is a set of File templates and Project templates for use with Xcode 4. These have been tested with Xcode 4.3 on Lion.

Using the Xcode 3 templates here: http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc/pyobjc-xcode/ as a starting point, and also using the existing Xcode 4 templates as a reference, I ported the Xcode 3 templates to the Xcode 4 format.

They seem to work, though I've only used the Cocoa-Python Application for actual development so far.

**How to use these**

Either clone this repo or download the zip and expand it. Copy the File Templates and Project Templates folders to the following path in your home directory, creating any missing intermediate directories if needed:

~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/

Launch Xcode 4. The File templates should be available from the template browser available when you choose File->New->File... -- they'll be listed under Mac OS X/Cocoa-Python.

The Project templates should be available when creating a new project, also under Mac OS X/Cocoa-Python.
